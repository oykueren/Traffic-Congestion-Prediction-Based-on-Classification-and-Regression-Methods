* The Data from all months are obtained.
* The data transformation is done.
* Data reduction is done.
* ST-DBCAN is applied to data based on time and location, and the data is labeled for congestion label.
* For Regression methods, SVR is applied to predict congestion label.
* For Classification methods, RFC is applied.
* For Classification methods, SVC is applied.
* For Regression methods, SVR is updated to predict speed.
* Evaluation for Classification Methods is applied.
* For Regression methods, RNN-LSTM is implemented to predict speed.
* For Regression methods, K-Means Clustering is applied to data concerning location, and the data is labeled for congestion labeled based on average speed.
* After Clustering, visualization was made on a clear street map to show how accurate it is.
* Evaluation for Classification and Regression Models is done.
