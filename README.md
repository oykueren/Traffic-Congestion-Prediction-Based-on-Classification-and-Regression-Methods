# Traffic Congestion Prediction Based on Classification and Regression Methods

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to predict traffic congestion using two distinct approaches: classification-based and regression-based methods. For the classification aspect, we have employed Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Random Forest Classifier to categorize traffic conditions. On the other hand, our regression-based approach utilizes Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression, and Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) to predict the severity and extent of traffic congestion. This comprehensive approach allows for a nuanced analysis of traffic patterns. The entire process, from data preparation to training and testing the models, is meticulously documented and accessible on our GitHub page. This repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in the intricacies of traffic congestion prediction, providing detailed insights into the methodologies and algorithms employed in our study.
